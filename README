The class OVH_APP is in the file ovh_app.py. I have included 2
examples:

- test_ovh.py: a simple command-line example
- test_bottle.py a simple webapp relying on bottle framework. With an
  app for sending text messages (SMS) and an other to display domain
  names. 

WARNING: The webapp is not secure and is vulnerable to cross-site
scripting. I am not checking the user input and I believe one could
try to call other API functions. This is there for simple
demonstration only. Do not use the demo webapp on production.
